        Why do we use it?
        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted 
        by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. 
        The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less 
        normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content 
        here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many 
        desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem 
        Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' 
        will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various 
        versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, 
        sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
